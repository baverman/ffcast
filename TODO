TODO

* record sound
* add predefined profiles/presets that export(encode) to video suitable for:
    * youtube/google video
    * ipod/iphone
    * very small flash videos for websites


MAYBE

* multi-head support? only if ffmpeg could record multiple screens into one video
* should I add an option that allows user to pass options directly to ffmpeg? \
  if I do, will I have to use eval? -- eval is dangerous
* ditch xwininfo and merge it's functionality into xrectsel.c, so -s option supports \
  click and select window, like with `scrot -s'. to do this, take a look at:
    scrot -> main.c -> scrot_sel_and_grab_image ()
    xwininfo -> xwininfo.c etc
* instead of calling ffmpeg directly from a shell script, is it worth it to rewrite \
  ffcast in C, linking to the libraries ffmpeg brings and the X11 library.
  The benefits may be a better control over the capture process:
    * enable follow-cursor, it's said to be supported by xvidcap and some others.
    * grab keyboard and define some shortcuts that will do things like:
        * move/resize capture area live
        * zooming
        * pause/stop capture
        * switch display on the fly
        * toggle selection indicator visibility
        * and all shortcuts should work globally on current display
  The pitfall is, this may actually bring more problems than feature, and take some effort.
* add ability to record tty. it's totally different from record X I suppose.
  if this is implemented, i'd like seamless switching beween X and tty. \
  that sounds tough huh.
  ttyrec is a tty screencaster, see: http://0xcc.net/ttyrec/


DONE

* xwininfo -display ${display} -- so we add an option for display
  xrecsel now takes argv[1] as display, so -d option should be fine now.
* add support for multi-window recording, like with gimp
* sanity: ffmpeg will quit if geometry is out of screen
* use Corners instead of Width/Height for the sake of Border width
* area selection, like drag a rectangle, instead of click windows (xrectsel)
* option to limit capture duration
